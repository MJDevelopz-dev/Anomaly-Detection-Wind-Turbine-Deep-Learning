# Anomaly Detection in Wind Turbine SCADA Data using LSTM & Bi-LSTM Autoencoders

## Master’s Thesis Project – Anomaly Detection in Wind Turbine Sensor Data using Deep Learning

This project represents part of my **master’s thesis written in Croatian**, titled:  
**“Detekcija anomalija u senzorskim podacima vjetroturbina pomoću dubokog učenja”**  
(*Anomaly Detection in Wind Turbine Sensor Data using Deep Learning*).

The focus of the work is on real-world **SCADA data** from literature, applying modern **feature selection techniques (XGBoost + SHAP)**, and preparing the data for **deep learning-based anomaly detection models**.

In the experimental part of the thesis, **LSTM Autoencoder** and **Bi-LSTM Autoencoder** models were developed and evaluated for detecting anomalies in **time series sensor data** collected from wind turbines.
